                <h2>What We Invest In</h2>
                <p>We're typically one of the first checks in, but we'll also go a little bit later if it's a deal we can get excited about. At the end of the day, we have complete discretion on what we invest in, no handcuffs from limited partners. That being said, we focus almost exclusively on B2B software where you can sell a small number of large contracts to customers who never cancel. Here are a few areas that we happen to be interested in at the moment:</p>
                
                <div class="investment-area">
                    <strong>Government Software</strong>
                    <p>Tough to sell to but never cancels. Plus we have a general disdain for the government's wasteful spending, so if we can make money off Uncle Sam, we're a fan. </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="investment-area">
                    <strong>Healthcare</strong>
                    <p>A mess of an industry that scares 99% of people away. That's what we like about it.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="investment-area">
                    <strong>Marketing Software</strong>
                    <p>We are performance marketing geeks with a vast network and really get excited about that kind of stuff.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="investment-area">
                    <strong>Dev Tools</strong>
                    <p>Spent over a decade building software. Love anything that helps developers.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="investment-area">
                    <strong>Vertical Software</strong>
                    <p>We're kind of breaking our own rule here on the whole "large contracts" thing, but having built one of the biggest home services businesses in the country, we understand vertical software really well and are willing to hop on the right opportunity.</p>

                <div class="investment-area">
                    <strong>Areas of Market Distortion</strong>
                    <p>Whenever there's something that messes with free markets, we see opportunity. Think government incentives, regulations, insurance </p>

                            <strong>Consumer companies</strong> - Even though that's our background, we have too many battle scars to be investors in it.

                        <div>
                            <strong>Non-technology plays</strong> - Sneakers, office space, and meal kits are great but at the end of the day, they were never going to be 80% gross margin businesses. So we can't pay venture prices for things like this.

                            <strong>Stuff we don't understand</strong> - There's a lot of things that are probably great businesses, but if we can't wrap our head around it at the end of the day, it's a pass. This precludes us from investing in probably some really cool deep tech and biotech stuff, but if we don't get it, it's not for us.

                    <p>Most importantly, we know firsthand that building a startup is brutal. You'll have more losses than wins, and more bad days than good. And some of those bad days can be really bad - we've been there before. We know that this is part of the game, and you can talk about the bad stuff anytime. Need someone to rant about an employee issue on a Friday night? That's us. Funding round fall through? Let us know.</p>

                <p>A company we invested in - that was and is doing spectacularly well - sent an investor update after reaching profitability. In the summary metrics, instead of writing "cash flow" or "profit," they wrote "burn" with a negative number. We found it both funny, and emblematic of the lack of fundamental business thinking in startups. So we decided to name our fund after it.</p>
                
                <p>Don't get us wrongâ€”there's absolutely a time and place to burn capital for growth. We're here to swing for the fences. But we prefer investing in founders who know the difference between investing in growth and lighting money on fire. There's a big difference in investing in the future ahead of profits, and hiring the Chainsmokers for your company holiday party.</p>
